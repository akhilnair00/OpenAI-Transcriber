# OpenAI Transcriber and Summarizer

Im in a lot of meetings these days and I am SICK of taking notes and then zoning out and then having incomplete notes. I want to first utilize the OpenAI API to transcribe the audio and then the gpt-4o mini model to summarize the content. Obviously, this won't work in a professional environment because you never know if ChatGPT will have a databreach in the future, thus I want to host a LLM on a private server/ locally that for my meeting summarization.
